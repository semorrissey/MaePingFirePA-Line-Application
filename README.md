# MaePing Fire Personal Assistant
Developed a web application with my project group to aid locals of Mae Ping National Park, Thailand in
predicting and managing wildfires. Incorporates a LINE chatbot, Nasa FIRMS satellite data, Windy.com API,
CuSense API, and D3 visualizations for fire maps. Available at https://maepingfirepa.herokuapp.com/

**NOTE**
This version is where I finished my research term and set it up to be picked up by other interested students in the future. The current version is found here:
